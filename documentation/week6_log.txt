This week my focus was on refining the details of the application. I made sure the one-dimensional algorithms reflected whether they found roots or minimums, added notes to the user about usage, and updated the initial function to be the same for all one-dimensional algorithms and the same for the multi-dimensional algorithms. I also checked pseudocode, descriptions, and the specific details for each algorithm to make sure they were accurate. I used Gemini CLI to publish my blog on the application that included the Gen-AI tutorial. I included my raw logs, but also I summarized my experiences, lessons learned, insights, and overall review of Gemini CLI in a separate tab in the blog section. I also tested functionality of the application, making sure data input works, different functions, different parameters, etc. I also fixed my README and clean up unused files.
